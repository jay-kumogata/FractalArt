# Altered Toroid

## Introduction

I ported Mr. SkyBerron's [Altered Toroid](https://twitter.com/SkyBerron/status/1588293399026843654) to Pyxel/Python. 
I lacked knowledge about PICO-8 and Lua, and they became different things. 
I had put it on the shelf, but this is interesting, so I will publish it.

## How to Run

Please execute the following from the Pyxel (version 1.7.0) environment.
